/**
 * A {@link Renderer} that uses a coarse-to-fine rendering scheme. First, a
 * small {@link BufferedImage} at a fraction of the canvas resolution is
 * rendered. Then, increasingly larger images are rendered, until the full
 * canvas resolution is reached.
 * <p>
 * When drawing the low-resolution {@link BufferedImage} to the screen, they
 * will be scaled up by Java2D to the full canvas size, which is relatively
 * fast. Rendering the small, low-resolution images is usually very fast, such
 * that the display is very interactive while the user changes the viewing
 * transformation for example. When the transformation remains fixed for a
 * longer period, higher-resolution details are filled in successively.
 * <p>
 * The renderer allocates a {@link BufferedImage} for each of a predefined set
 * of <em>screen scales</em> (a screen scale of 1 means that 1 pixel in the
 * screen image is displayed as 1 pixel on the canvas, a screen scale of 0.5
 * means 1 pixel in the screen image is displayed as 2 pixel on the canvas,
 * etc.)
 * <p>
 * At any time, one of these screen scales is selected as the
 * <em>highest screen scale</em>. Rendering starts with this highest screen
 * scale and then proceeds to lower screen scales (higher resolution images).
 * Unless the highest screen scale is currently rendering,
 * {@link #requestRepaint() repaint request} will cancel rendering, such that
 * display remains interactive.
 * <p>
 * The renderer tries to maintain a per-frame rendering time close to a desired
 * number of <code>targetRenderNanos</code> nanoseconds. If the rendering time
 * (in nanoseconds) for the (currently) highest scaled screen image is above
 * this threshold, a coarser screen scale is chosen as the highest screen scale
 * to use. Similarly, if the rendering time for the (currently) second-highest
 * scaled screen image is below this threshold, this finer screen scale chosen
 * as the highest screen scale to use.
 * <p>
 * The renderer uses multiple threads (if desired) and double-buffering (if
 * desired).
 * <p>
 * Double buffering means that three {@link BufferedImage BufferedImages} are
 * created for every screen scale. After rendering the first one of them and
 * setting it to the {@link RenderTarget}, next time, rendering goes to the
 * second one, then to the third. The {@link RenderTarget} will always have a
 * complete image, which is not rendered to while it is potentially drawn to the
 * screen. When setting an image to the {@link RenderTarget}, the
 * {@link RenderTarget} will release one of the previously set images to be
 * rendered again. Thus, rendering will not interfere with painting the
 * {@link BufferedImage} to the canvas.
